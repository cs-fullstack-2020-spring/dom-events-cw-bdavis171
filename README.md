### Problem 1:
Create a simple grid system as seen in the attached picture. Put a button called "1" in your main section and another button called "2" in your sidebar section. Put the number 0 in your header. If you click the #1 button the title in your header should change to "1" and the background to blue. If you click the #2 button the title in your header should change to "2" and the background to red. Use classlist to change the background.
